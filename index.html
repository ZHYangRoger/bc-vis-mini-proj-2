                <p>For our project, we chose to use the “used cars catalog” dataset from Kaggle Datasets. This dataset contains 38,000 entries of used car listing and sales information in Belarus, including listed price, duration listed, and many attributes related to the cars listed. In order for us to understand the different aspects of the Belarussian used car market, we looked into 3 topics as follows:</p>

                    <p>
                        We decided to explore the used car market because one of our team members is obsessed with cars. After searching through the databases, with our topics in mind, we found this dataset with a myriad of useful categories and appropriate amount entries for our analysis. Some of the key categories we looked for are the listing price, the duration listed on the market, the year manufactured, and as many details about the cars as possible. These classifications allow us to compare car functionalities and characteristics to its price and its popularity on the market inferred from its duration listed. The dataset happens to contain information specific to Belarus and we are able to deduce many interesting economical and political implications from the used car sales data.

                            We structured our analysis progressively so that in answering our first topic question, we are able to provide context for data filtering and grouping that contributes to the next two topics. At first, we selected the useful categories from the list of 30 data columns and disregarded the columns like “features” with unstandardized information. In our first topic, we identified the price factors, such as year manufactured and brand, that provided valuable insights for the appropriate groupings within these categories that would help us understand the following topics.

                        <p>
                            Initially, as it is one of the most discussed topics about used cars, we wanted to find correlations between used cars depreciation and their characteristics. However, as we processed the dataset, we realized that there wasn’t enough information to draw truthful conclusions. After comparing with other datasets online and researching the original sticker prices of some used cars, we decided not to focus on the value depreciation using this dataset to ensure our visualizations’ truthfulness. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We then decided to explore the data in the 3 topics listed above: the contributing factors to used car pricing, the characteristics of the most listed cars, and the most popular ones. In our exploration, we started by asking questions related to the effective data categories we identified previously. For example, for our first topic, we wondered what are the most expensive used car brands in Belarus and what are the cheapest? We raised questions like what brands are the most expensive on the market and how do used cars hold up their values relative to their listed age and mileage? We were able to use a combination of scatter plots and bar charts to visualize the correlation, and the price information allowed us to group the different car brands by their affordability for our analysis in the proceeding topics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For our second topic, we looked into the number of cars listed by their brands grouped by body style, drivetrain, manufacturer by region, year manufactured, and affordability. We wanted to know what are the most common, thus most listed used cars on the market and how they compare to our experience in the US market?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For our third topic, we used the duration listed on the market before selling as a metric to decide how popular the cars are, and with various characteristics, determine what makes a used car in Belarus the popular option?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Take our second topic for example. In order to answer what are the most common and most listed cars, we first tried plotting out the count of listings by car brand in a bar chart. This gave us a pretty arbitrary representation for us to interpret. We then decided to focus on the geographical context of these car brands and grouped the manufacturers by their region. In order to make sense of the data in the sense of market shares, we considered pie charts and treemaps and chose to use a treemap because it is easier to see the area difference. We then applied the same concept to analyzing using the affordability metric of the used cars according to our findings in the first topic. For our analysis of the most common listings by year manufactured, we first looked at the count of listings by year in a line chart. We saw a significant curve in the line that shows the peak of the car count is around the 2000s era, which was surprising to us. We then wanted to understand how the different decades compare in terms of market composition, so we grouped the year manufactured information by decades and presented it using treemaps.

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="column">
                            For our first topic, we wanted to understand the factors contributing to the prices of used cars in Belarus. We looked at the average prices in relation to the manufacturer, year manufactured, the drivetrain and its listed mileage. As presented on our first chart, most of the more expensive cars listed are from well-known luxury brands in Europe as well as imported cars from the US. Surprisingly, we found that the average prices for Mercedes-Benzs and BMWs are barely above average, and that of Audi is even below the overall average, but we were able to make sense of this finding later in our analysis in our second topic. Not surprisingly, we found that most newer cars are priced significantly higher than the older ones, and that the all wheel drive (AWD) cars are priced way above the two wheel drive cars, with FWD cars leading the price competition. These findings were later useful for our interpretations in our following topics. In the mileage section, we were also surprised to see how big the odometer numbers are compared to what we are used to seeing in the US. Cars are listed at running conditions from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars with over a million miles on the odometer, showing how much cars are driven before they exhaust their value. Our findings in this section showed that newer, AWD cars from European and American luxury brands are priced the highest, while older Russian and most Asian 2WD cars are sold at lower prices.

                        <div class="column">
                            For our second topic, we incorporated a lot of the findings in the first topic to help us answer what are the most common and most listed used cars in Belarus. The most interesting finding is that the majority of the used cars listed are from the 2000s and the 1990s, which is quite different from the used car market here in the US. Most of the cars are sedans and hatchbacks which are more common for the production cars in the decades from 1990 to 2010. Also, the majority of the cars are FWD, staying consistent with our previous analysis because most of the sedans and hatchbacks in the era are FWD. RWD are usually associated with sporty cars and AWD are usually found on newer, more luxurious models or SUVs. Also, during the winter in Belarus, the snow makes RWD cars very dangerous to drive, so most people would opt for the cheaper and safer FWD options. Then, interestingly, through grouping the manufacturers by region, we found that the automobile market in Belarus by volume is staying local and supporting the European car manufacturers, with Asian manufacturers chasing behind, and American imports at the very last. Last but not least, grouping the car brands by affordability from the first topic, we found that most cars listed are from more affordable brands like honda and Chinese brand Lifan; and mid-tier, well known decent brands like dodge and. We were also able to make sense of the low average prices for commonly perceived luxury brands like BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz. Aside from the fact that these brands Europe were sold without import taxes, most of the cars are from the 1990s to 2010, and the models during this period were not priced significantly above the other less prominent brands nowadays, thus contributing to their lower prices compared to brands like Cadillac and Acura. From all of these information, we can reason that FWD sedans from affordable European brands around the 2000s are the most common listings on the Belarussian used car market.

                            For our third topic, we wanted to explore the buyer's side and find out what makes a car more popular and sells more quickly on the Belarussian used car market. We decided to use the duration listed as our metric for popularity, so we visualized the comparisons in bar charts to ensure a truthful presentation of the differences. Again, consistent with our previous analysis, FWD cars are the most popular variant by far compared to RWD and AWD cars, and the cars from the 1990s are not only the most commonly listed, but also the most popular options. Moreover, used cars from the 1990s are also as popular as they are common on the used car market, and European cars remain the most popular option with American brands ranking last.  There were, however, a few very surprising findings. First, manual cars are more popular than automatic cars by a decent margin. We supposed it was because the older, cheaper, European cars are mostly manual by default in the 1990s and 2000s, and the driving habits of Belarussians are probably closer to that of more western Europeans than Americans, which contributes to manual cars being the more popular option. Also, interestingly, liftback models surpassed sedans and hatchbacks by far as the most popular body style in Belarus. This is most likely because the liftbacks have similar exterior profiles to a regular sedan while having the space and practicality of a hatchback. As a side note, if you try to sell your orange car in Belarus, you’ll have a hard time! Looking at all of the categories in consideration, we could infer that the more affordable and practical cars are more popular in Belarus.

                            From this project, we realized the amount of considerations put into creating stories from a dataset. We needed to revise our visual design multiple times to find the most accurate and visually appealing presentation, and we had to deliberately filter and group the dataset in order to come up with more truthful and meaningful stories.
